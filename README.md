# KytyPS5: Marvel's Wolverine on Linux + AMD

> [!NOTE]
> **Fork of [KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5) focused on running Marvel's Wolverine
> (PPSA03671) on Linux with AMD GPUs (Mesa RADV).** It is not the official KytyPS5 repository; for
> other games and the latest KytyPS5, use [KytyPS5/KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5).
> You need your own dump of the game: no game files, keys or firmware are included.

**Status (2026-10-08), work in progress.** Tested on a Ryzen 7 5800X3D + Radeon RX 7900 XT, Mesa RADV,
Linux 7.2, in the opening jungle area:

| | Frame rate |
|---|---|
| Standing / exploring | ~22 fps (~20 on 2026-10-07, ~10 on 2026-10-05) |
| Combat | ~11-16 fps (varies a lot with the fight) |
| Heavy combat (fire, many enemies) | 7-12 fps |

The goal is a stable 30 fps. Build and run instructions: **[packaging/wolverine/linux-amd](packaging/wolverine/linux-amd/README.md)**.

## What was done

**Getting it to run and render correctly on AMD/RADV**
- Title screen, menus and gameplay: shader clock divisor, mesh draws over 65535 groups split, BC6H/BC7
  3D image flags, out-of-bounds fix in the ATRAC9 audio decoder (combat crash).
- Character models: vertices that export no position are culled instead of left undefined (orange/black
  slabs over faces); guest wave32 mesh shaders run one guest wave per pass (cracks in skin, clothes and
  ground); wave32 vertex shaders wrap the lane index at 32 (strand geometry).
- Effects: pixel shaders run with the guest's wave size (rainbow sparkles on sparks, fire and smoke).

**No gameplay stutter from shader compiles**
- Warm shader cache plus asynchronous pipeline compiles: shader recompiles during play went from ~27 s
  per session to a few milliseconds.

**Performance of the emulated GPU command processor** (the main bottleneck), each change measured
with a same-process A/B switch:
- Replay traces of the shader resource walk (port of Senaxx's work) and an in-order replay of the walk:
  about +20% together.
- `FindImage` memo, texture description cache, lazy timeline-semaphore queries, shader-expansion
  hashing, a shared address-space lock for write-tracking protections, bigger fault-ahead and readback
  windows, GPU-side data loads for shaders whose data the GPU itself just wrote, PGO builds.
- 2026-10-08 (command processor -11% per frame): the in-order walk replay runs a flat recorded request
  list; replay traces drop pass-through ops and repeated user-data reads at record time; the vertex/mesh
  stage of a draw materializes its resources on a worker thread while the command processor does the
  pixel stage; per-descriptor diagnostics and hot-path clock reads off by default.
- GPU: the mesh-indirect argument conversions of a render pass run in one batch before it begins, so
  those draws no longer end the render pass (~5 points less GPU load).

**Tooling** (all behind `KYTY_*` switches, most of them changeable while the game runs): GPU and
command-buffer profilers, readback and write-fault statistics, verify modes for every replay/memo,
scripted gameplay A/B runs.

## Next

- Command processor (still the limit, ~39 ms of CPU per frame, ~130k instructions per draw): a pipelined
  command processor (resource preparation of the next draws ahead of the current one) or draw records
  (skip the whole per-draw preparation for repeated draws), needed for 30 fps and for heavy combat.
- GPU: the frame is still split into many small, serialized pieces (barriers, render-pass breaks).

**[Weekly updates](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5/discussions/862)** — game progress, recent fixes and ongoing development.

**[Development on Discord](https://discord.gg/UNrkMqGaBg)** — KytyPS5 development.

KytyPS5 is a free and open-source PlayStation 5 emulator written in C++ for Windows and Linux,
with experimental macOS support. It is based on a heavily modified version of
[Kyty](https://github.com/InoriRus/Kyty). The project is in active development, and behavior
can change significantly between builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> KytyPS5 is not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment or PlayStation. The project does
> not distribute games or copyrighted system software. Use only game files that you have obtained
> legally.

## Current Status

KytyPS5 can boot 2D games and a selection of 3D games, including titles built with Unreal Engine
4/5, Unity, and custom engines. External low-level emulation modules are neither required nor
planned.

Development is currently focused on expanding game compatibility and improving boot reliability.

Windows and Linux are the primary platforms and receive the most testing.

macOS support is experimental. The emulator is built for x86-64 and runs on Apple Silicon under
Rosetta 2, with Vulkan provided by MoltenVK. A small number of titles have been verified in-game
on Apple Silicon hardware; see [Building on macOS](#building-on-macos).

Community game test results are available in the
[KytyPS5 Compatibility List](https://kytyps5.github.io/).

## Bugs and Issues

Compatibility, stability, and performance can vary between versions. You may encounter crashes
or graphical glitches, so please include the version you tested when reporting an issue.

## Contributing

Testing games and submitting detailed bug reports are useful ways to contribute. Search existing
issues first, then use the **Game Emulation Status Report** template and attach the complete log file.

Code contributions should be focused, build successfully on the platforms they touch, and include
relevant tests where practical. Windows is the primary target, so a change that alters shared code
should not regress it; changes confined to a platform's own code paths only need to build there. Because KytyPS5 is still evolving quickly, consider opening an issue before
starting a large change.

### Formatting

Set up the clang-format hook after cloning:

Install `pre-commit` using the method appropriate for your platform:

- **Arch Linux / CachyOS:** `sudo pacman -S pre-commit`
- **Other Linux / macOS / Windows:** `python -m pip install pre-commit`

Then install the Git hook:

```bash
python -m pre_commit install --install-hooks
```

It formats staged `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.inc` files in `src`.

## Developer Information

The PS5 graphics architecture is based on AMD RDNA 2. Use AMD's
[RDNA 2 Instruction Set Architecture Reference Guide (document 70648)](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/rdna2-shader-instruction-set-architecture)
as the primary instruction-encoding reference when working on shader decoding and recompilation.

Important areas of the codebase:

- [`src/graphics/shader/recompiler`](src/graphics/shader/recompiler) — instruction decoding,
  intermediate representation, control flow, resource tracking, and SPIR-V emission
- [`src/graphics/guest_gpu`](src/graphics/guest_gpu) — PS5 (Prospero) GPU formats and command processing
- [`src/graphics/host_gpu`](src/graphics/host_gpu) — Vulkan host backend and resource management
- [`tests`](tests) — focused memory, shader, and resource-tracking regression tests

The renderer targets Vulkan 1.3. Keep shader changes aligned with both the RDNA 2 ISA semantics and
the Vulkan/SPIR-V validation rules.

## Building

### System requirements

- Windows 10 version 1803, a current Linux distribution, or macOS on Apple Silicon
- A 64-bit x86 processor (on macOS, an Apple Silicon processor with Rosetta 2)
- A Vulkan 1.3-capable GPU with current drivers (on macOS, Vulkan is provided by the bundled
  MoltenVK)

### Build requirements (Windows)

- Git
- CMake 3.22.1 or newer
- Ninja
- Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and
  **C++ Clang tools for Windows** component
- Qt 6 for MSVC 2022 64-bit, including Concurrent, Network, and Widgets
- [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/releases) (`glslangValidator`) on `PATH`

The Microsoft C++ compiler (`cl.exe`) is not supported; use `clang-cl`.

Open an **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022** (or the equivalent Developer
PowerShell), change to the repository root, and initialize the dependencies:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Configure the project. Replace the Qt path with the version installed on your system:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B _Build/windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.x.x/msvc2022_64"
```

Build the launcher and stage a runnable installation:

```powershell
cmake --build _Build/windows --target launcher
cmake --install _Build/windows --prefix _Build/windows/install
```

The finished application and its runtime dependencies will be placed in
`_Build/windows/install`.

### Building on Linux

Install the toolchain and the libraries the bundled SDL3 needs. Without the audio, Wayland and
udev development packages SDL3 quietly configures itself without those backends, and the resulting
build has no working sound and no gamepad hotplug:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
  clang lld ninja-build cmake git glslang-tools pkg-config \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev \
  libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols
```

Qt 6 (Concurrent, Network, Widgets) is required for the launcher — either the distribution packages
(`qt6-base-dev`) or an official Qt installation.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR"

cmake --build _Build/linux --target launcher --parallel
cmake --install _Build/linux --prefix _Build/linux/install
```

The install step copies the Qt libraries and plugins next to the binaries, so
`_Build/linux/install` runs without a matching system Qt. FFmpeg is linked statically
from the pinned [KytyPS5 FFmpeg core](https://github.com/KytyPS5/ext-ffmpeg-core)
release, including VP9 and WebM support. System FFmpeg packages are not required.

To build `kyty_emulator` and the `kyty_tests` target without Qt, use a separate build directory:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/linux-no-qt -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DKYTY_BUILD_LAUNCHER=OFF

cmake --build _Build/linux-no-qt --target kyty_emulator kyty_tests --parallel
```

As on Windows, the MSVC compiler is not used; Clang is required. `cl.exe` is rejected at configure
time.

The CMake source root is the repository root.

### Building on NixOS

A development shell provides Clang, CMake, Ninja, Qt 6, the Vulkan headers, and the SDL3 backend
libraries. Enter it and configure exactly as on other Linux distributions; the shell exports
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`, so the `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR"` argument is not
needed:

```bash
nix-shell # or: nix develop
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++

cmake --build _Build/linux --target launcher --parallel
cmake --install _Build/linux --prefix _Build/linux/install
```

The configure step downloads the FFmpeg prebuilts and the `xbyak`, `zydis`, `zstd`, and ZArchive
sources, so it needs network access; a fully sandboxed `nix build` would require vendoring those
inputs. A Vulkan 1.3 driver must be available at runtime (on NixOS,
`hardware.graphics.enable = true`).

### Building on macOS

macOS builds target x86-64 and run under Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon, so the PS5's x86-64 game
code executes through the same translation layer as the emulator itself. Prebuilt archives are
attached to releases; the steps below are for building from source.

Requirements:

- An Apple Silicon Mac with Rosetta 2 installed (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`)
- Xcode (or the Command Line Tools)
- Homebrew packages: `brew install cmake ninja glslang`
- Qt 6 (Concurrent, Network, Widgets) with x86-64 support. The official Qt installation is
  universal and works; Homebrew's Qt is arm64-only and will not link

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/macos -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR"

cmake --build _Build/macos --target launcher --parallel
cmake --install _Build/macos --prefix _Build/macos/install
```

The build re-signs `kyty_emulator` with the JIT entitlements it needs to execute translated
guest code; no manual signing step is required. When the launcher is built, the install
also produces `_Build/macos/install/KytyPS5.app` — double-click to launch the GUI.
A flat `kyty_emulator` is kept for CLI usage.

Vulkan comes from MoltenVK. Download `MoltenVK-macos.tar` from the
[MoltenVK releases](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/releases), then copy
`MoltenVK/dynamic/dylib/macOS/libMoltenVK.dylib` next to the flat `kyty_emulator`
(and, for the bundle, into `KytyPS5.app/Contents/Frameworks/`) and ad-hoc sign it:

```bash
codesign --force --sign - _Build/macos/install/libMoltenVK.dylib
# For the bundle (if present):
codesign --force --sign - _Build/macos/install/KytyPS5.app/Contents/Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib
codesign --force --sign - _Build/macos/install/KytyPS5.app
```

Release archives already include a signed `libMoltenVK.dylib` (both flat and inside the bundle).

### Regression tests

Build every regression executable and run the registered tests with:

```powershell
cmake --build _Build/windows --target kyty_tests
ctest --test-dir _Build/windows --output-on-failure
```

Use `_Build/linux` instead of `_Build/windows` for a Linux build.

### Visual Studio Code

A ready-made Visual Studio Code setup is included in [`.vscode`](.vscode). It configures CMake
Tools to build the project with Ninja and `clang-cl` and provides launch profiles for both
`launcher.exe` and `kyty_emulator.exe`. It is Windows-only: VS Code settings cannot select a
compiler per platform, so on Linux configure from the command line as shown above.

Before using it:

1. Install the **CMake Tools** and **C/C++** extensions in Visual Studio Code.
2. Update `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` in [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) to point to your
   Qt 6 MSVC installation.
3. Update the `--game` path in [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) for the
   **Debug kyty_emulator** profile.
4. Open the repository in an x64 Visual Studio developer environment, configure the CMake project,
   and select a launch profile from **Run and Debug**.

## Running

Update your graphics driver before reporting rendering problems.

To use the graphical launcher:

```powershell
.\_Build\windows\install\launcher.exe
```

```bash
./_Build/linux/install/launcher
```

```bash
open _Build/macos/install/KytyPS5.app  # or double-click in Finder
```

On first launch, add one or more game folders in the global settings. The launcher searches those
folders recursively for game directories containing `eboot.bin` and ZArchive (`.zar`) game dumps
whose archive root contains `eboot.bin`. Select a detected game and run it from the game list.
ZArchive dumps are mounted read-only and streamed directly; they do not need to be extracted first.

The emulator can also be started directly with a legally obtained game directory, ELF file, or
ZArchive dump:

```powershell
.\_Build\windows\install\kyty_emulator.exe --game "D:\Games\ExampleGame"
.\_Build\windows\install\kyty_emulator.exe --game "D:\Games\ExampleGame.zar"
```

```bash
./_Build/linux/install/kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame"
./_Build/linux/install/kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame.zar"
```

On macOS, the adjacent flat or app-bundled `libMoltenVK.dylib` is found automatically; no
environment variable is required:

```bash
./_Build/macos/install/kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame"
```

To override the Vulkan loader, set `SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY`:

```bash
SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY=/path/to/libMoltenVK.dylib ./kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame"
```

Run `kyty_emulator --help` to see the available graphics, logging, validation, profiling, and
debugging options.

### AI Use

AI tools may be used for research, reverse engineering, and development assistance. Contributors
must fully understand, review, and test all code they submit and remain responsible for its
correctness. Repository communication, including pull-request descriptions, code comments, and
issue comments, must come from the human contributor rather than an autonomous AI agent.

Pull requests that include AI-assisted or AI-generated work should disclose the scope of the AI
involvement and describe the human review and testing performed before submission. Unverified or
untested generated changes may be closed without review.
